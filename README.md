# Robo-Speaker
The Robo Speaker is a Python-based voice output application that takes user input (text) and converts it into speech using a text-to-speech engine. It allows your computer to "speak" what you type â€” just like a robot assistant.

ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries Used:
1)Python â€“ the main programming language
2) pyttsx3 â€“ text-to-speech library (works offline)
3) (Optional): os module for platform control

ðŸ§  How It Works:
1) The user types a message.
2) The program sends the text to the pyttsx3 engine.
3) The engine converts the text into voice and speaks it out loud.

Features:
1. Converts typed text into speech
2. Works offline (no internet needed)
3. Can be used for:
    1. Voice alerts
    2. Educational tools
    3. Accessibility support
